1. General info
Canoepolo tactics board is an open source project based on the sports tactics board project found at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sportstacticsbd/
I started this project during the first weeks of the corona virus lockdown, as I was searching for a way to discus tactics without the possibility to physically come together and use a magnet or chalk-board. The program is modified in such a way that it only provides a tactics board for canoe polo, but with added functionality needed specifically for the sport, like rotating players. I also added the possibility to save a sequence as a video, to make it easier to share tactics with other people.
